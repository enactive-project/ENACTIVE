### Deep Excitatory-Inhibitory Factorized Maneuver (ENACTIVE) learning
This repository contains PyTorch implementations of deep excitatory-inhibitory factorized maneuver (ENACTIVE) learning algorithms and training framework.
### Requirements
Pytorch 1.8  
numpy 1.15.2  
matplotlib 3.0.0  
tensorflow  
redis  
### Environment
The experimental environment used is WUKONG, a RL oriented air combat simulation framework currently under development by Northwestern Polytechnical University(NPU).
Due to copyright issues, we are unable to open source this simulation environment, but we have opened up interface information related to the environment in the code, 
which can be found in environment/battlespace.py. Through the interface file, you can gain a glimpse of the functionality of the simulation environment.
